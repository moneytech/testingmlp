# testingmlp: Testing memory-level parallelism

Processor cores can issue multiple memory requests. How many concurrent memory requests can your processor cores support?

The answer seem to vary between 1 and 25, more or less. 

To assess memory-level parallelism, we designed a pointer-chasing benchmark that relies on multiple "lanes" (independent pointer-chasing routines). By increasing the number of "lanes" up to the point where performance stops increasing, we can measure the level parallelism in your processor.

Our benchmark is designed for Linux. It won't work on Windows.

One limitation of our approach has to do with page walking: we work we are RAM-size array and the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is put to work. If at all possible, you should run this benchmark with transparent huge pages. If you cannot, then report this limitation along with your numbers.




## Usage

```
make
./testingmlp
```


## Sample output

```
$ ./testingmlp
Initializing array made of 33554432 64-bit words.
Applying Sattolo's algorithm.
Surgery on the long cycle.
Verifying the neighboring distance...
mindist = 335544 vs 335544
Time to sum up the array (linear scan) 0.011 s (x 8 = 0.084 s), bandwidth = 24256.2 MB/s
Legend:
  BandW: Implied bandwidth (assuming 64-byte cache line) in MB/s
  % Eff: Effectiness of this lane count compared to the prior, as a % of ideal
  Speedup: Speedup factor for this many lanes versus one lane
